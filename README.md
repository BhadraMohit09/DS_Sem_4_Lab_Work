### 📚 Key Data Structures Covered

#### 1. Arrays 📊

* **Definition:** A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
* **Operations:** Insertion, deletion, searching, sorting.
* **Applications:** Storing lists of data, implementing matrices, basic data storage.
* **Visual Representation:**

#### 2. Linked Lists 🔗

* **Definition:** A linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element (node) contains a data part and a pointer to the next node.
* **Types:** Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists.
* **Operations:** Insertion, deletion, traversal.
* **Applications:** Implementing stacks, queues, dynamic memory allocation.
* **Visual Representation:**

#### 3. Stacks 🥞

* **Definition:** A LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure.
* **Operations:** Push, pop, peek.
* **Applications:** Function call management, expression evaluation, undo/redo functionality.
* **Visual Representation:**

#### 4. Queues ⏳

* **Definition:** A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure.
* **Operations:** Enqueue, dequeue, peek.
* **Applications:** Task scheduling, print queues, breadth-first search.

#### 6. Graphs 🌐

* **Definition:** A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
* **Types:** Directed graphs, undirected graphs, weighted graphs.
* **Operations:** Traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms.
* **Applications:** Social networks, mapping, network routing.
